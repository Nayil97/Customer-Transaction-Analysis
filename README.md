# Customer Transaction Behavior Analysis using SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer transaction behavior using SQL, focusing on understanding spending patterns, transaction frequency, preferred transaction types, and fraud detection. The insights generated can help banks optimize their services and tailor financial products for different customer segments.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes transaction details with the following key attributes:
- **Transaction Details**: Transaction ID, Type, Amount, Status, Timestamp
- **Customer Identifiers**: Sender & Receiver Account IDs
- **Device & Location Data**: Device Used, Geolocation, PIN Code
- **Network Information**: Latency, Bandwidth
- **Fraud Indicators**: Fraud Flag

## Project Goals
- Analyze customer spending behavior
- Identify frequently used transaction types
- Detect high-value customers
- Examine transaction patterns by device and location
- Identify potential fraud trends

## SQL Analysis Steps
### 1. Data Exploration
- Load dataset into a SQL database
- Inspect data for missing values and inconsistencies

### 2. Customer Transaction Patterns
- Identify customers with the highest number of transactions
- Calculate average transaction amounts per customer

### 3. Transaction Type Analysis
- Determine the most common transaction types
- Analyze transaction types used by specific customers

### 4. Device & Location Analysis
- Identify most used devices for transactions
- Analyze transaction patterns by geolocation

### 5. Fraud Detection Insights
- Detect customers with frequent fraudulent transactions
- Calculate fraud rates per transaction type

## Business Insights
- Identify high-value customers for premium banking services
- Optimize ATM placements based on transaction locations
- Improve fraud detection mechanisms by analyzing transaction anomalies
- Enhance user experience by understanding preferred transaction methods

## Project Deliverables
- **SQL Queries** for data analysis
- **Data Visualization** (Power BI/Tableau) for enhanced insights (Optional)
- **Final Report** summarizing key findings and recommendations

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite
- **Query Language**: SQL
- **Version Control**: GitHub
